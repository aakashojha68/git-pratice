git remote -v  -> gives you remote alias with repo url.
git remote add [alias_name] [repo_url] -> add repo url with alias_name in order to push code in future.

git branch -M main -> changes current branch name to main (main is the branch name)


git push -u origin main -> "-u" means setting upstream. "-u" is the alais of "origin main" which can be used to push code.
eg: 
suppose first time you run this "git push -u origin main" in order to push code.
this means that you have set -u as alais to "origin main". To push code in same repo for next time, you only have to run this "git push -u".
